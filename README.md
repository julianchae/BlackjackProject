### BlackjackProject
#### Overview
We were tasked to create a black jack game that preformed functions that a normal blackjack game would have.
When ran, the program generated two hands, one for the dealer and one for the player. One of the dealers' cards were hidden, while we knew both of our cards. From there, we were able to hit(add a card) or stay. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 without busting(Going over).
The dealer's guidelines were simple: he/she were to hit if his starting cards were under 17, and stay of he were over.
If the dealer went over 21, the player won. If the player went over 21, the dealer won.
#### Technologies used
Some technologies used were loops, switch statements, abstraction, enums, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

#### Lessons learned

I'm 100% certain I will not get credit for this assignment, I underestimated it's difficulty and was unable to figure out some of the logic that applied in the app class.
However, while building this program, I solidified my understanding of OOP, encapsulation, abstraction and inheritance. While I was unable to finish my program, I learned a lot from this project.

#### What was fun

This project was hard... really hard. It really brought together everything we learned in the past month and had us apply it. I am unhappy I was unable to get my program functioning properly, although I feel as if it is very close to being finished. I think I had the hard part out of the way for the most part, I just stumbled on the logic.
